# js-intro by Stocard

This repository contains the presentation shown in the workshop "Your app backend from scratch with Node.js" at Stocard, as well as the source code of all scripts we have shown and written during the workshop.

For any questions, feel free to contact Lukas Stehr <stehr@stocard.de> or Florian Barth <barth@stocard.de>! You can also create a github issue for questions or send us a pull request to correct any errors we might have made, if you feel nerdy ;)
